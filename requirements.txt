To close out this lesson, you're responsible for creating a responsive web page for a Star Wars "trading card" site. You'll have to write CSS for a 960px twelve column responsive grid, and HTML and CSS to implement the layout called for by our designs. This project will demonstrate your mastery of responsive design basics.

You'll work in a repl.it that we provide and reference images from a list of links we'll give you below. As in the challenge at the end of the previous lesson on forms, we provide a scenario followed by project requirements and designs, and finally a link to an example solution.

The Scenario: From Topps to bottom (and back again?)
Throughout the twentieth century, Topps was the top brand in baseball trading cards. However, in the digital twenty-first century, Topps has seen sales plummet, and the company is experimenting with digital trading cards as a new product.

The product team is in the prototyping stage, and they've tasked you with implementing the designs below. Your job is to create a page for a line of Star Wars themed trading cards. The page has two layouts, one for mobile, and one for screens wider than 640px.

Requirements
You are building a page as represented in the design found below this list of requirements.

Fork this repl.it, saving as you go. Note that the URL changes each time you save, so you can refer back to previous versions.
Implement and use a 960px twelve column grid system using the float: left; approach. Code for your grid should go in a separate stylesheet.
Modify the existing index.html as necessary to achieve the layout.
Add a main.css file for any styles you need to achieve the layout. The CSS for your grid, however, should not go in this file.
When the screen width is less than 640px, columns should take up 100% of their parent container's width, but there should continue to be padding between the card and the edge of the viewport.
When the screen is 640px or wider, the columns should take up the correct width.
When the screen is wider than 1000px, the grid should stop expanding, and it should be centered in the browser window.
The page should be SEO- and accessibility-friendly. From now on, these should be default requirements for every page you create.
When you're done, save your work and submit a link to your project below to let your mentor know it's time to review your code.
Be sure to discuss this project with your mentor when you're finished.

Solution
As always, you're on the honor system. Before peeking at this solution, we ask that you spend at least three hours trying to code this project on your own. That doesn't mean you shouldn't reach out for help if you get stuck. If you're stuck, but still within the three-hour time limit, reach out to a fellow student or mentor on Slack.
